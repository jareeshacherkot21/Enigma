### Project Description
Automated water irrigation system using an arduino uno ,soil sensor, relay module,humidity sensor 
Automated Water Irrigation System for your small Garden or any Potted Plant using simple Arduino UNO Board ,a Soil Sensor and a 5 Volt Relay Module. I have also explained everything regarding Soil Moisture Sensor and Automatic Plant Watering System. 

### The Problem statement
1: What is the primary goal of this project?

A: To develop an automated watering system that efficiently delivers water to plants based on real-time soil moisture readings, thereby optimizing plant growth and minimizing water consumption.
Q2: What are the core components of the system?

A: The system utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a humidity sensor (e.g., DHT22), a water pump, a relay module, a water source, and connecting components.
Q3: How does the system determine when to water the plants?

A: The humidity sensor continuously monitors the soil moisture level. The Arduino compares this reading to a pre-defined threshold. When the moisture level falls below the threshold, the Arduino triggers the relay, which in turn activates the water pump.
Q4: How is the water delivered to the plants?

A: The water pump draws water from the water source and delivers it to the plants through tubing.
Q5: What are the benefits of using an automated watering system?

A: The benefits include:
Water Conservation: Prevents overwatering by delivering water only when needed.
Consistent Watering: Ensures plants receive the optimal amount of water, promoting healthy growth.
Reduced Labor: Eliminates the need for manual watering, saving time and effort.
Improved Yields: Healthier plants generally lead to better yields.
Remote Monitoring (Potential): Future iterations could include remote monitoring and control capabilities.
